# Exercise 4 (Matlab)
To run our experiments, run the standalone file *oneplusone.m*. Plots will be created and relevant outputs will be written to the Matlab shell.

# Exercise 6 (Matlab)
To run our experiments simply run the script *comparison.m*. Note that the files *ga.m*, *att48.tsp* and *file-tsp.txt* should be in the same folder as *comparison.m*. This will run the same experiments with the default hyperparameters. If one wishes to change these, one can do so in that same script.
This script will automatically create relevant plots and output performance indicators to the matlab shell.

# Exercise 8 (Python)
For exercise 8 one needs the *gplearn* package, which can be installed using *pip install gplearn* or a similar method. The script can be run by itself, and should show the output interactively, as well as create the relevant plots.
